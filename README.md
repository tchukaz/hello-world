Anywhere you see "hello-world", just know it is the first attempt at doing something.
Hey there! My name is Fiva and I am Nigerian. I have a basic knowledge of Html, Css, jQuery and JavaScript.
Learning to code has been an amazing journey for me and I am grateful to kingzLoFitness for introducing me to FreeCodeCamp.
